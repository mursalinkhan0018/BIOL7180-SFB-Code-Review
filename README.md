# BIOL7180-SFB-Code-Review
Code Review for the https://github.com/netZoo/netZooM

Paper of the code review:
In the code review for the scripting for biologist I am performing to review codes for the ![Camila et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124720307762). In the paper they used MATLAB based ![netZooM](https://github.com/netZoo/netZooM) to create the gene networks. More specifically they used the `PANDA` (Passing Attributes between Networks for Data Assimilation), which is a message-passing model using multiple sources of information to predict regulatory relationships, and used it to integrate protein-protein interaction, gene expression, and sequence motif data to reconstruct genome-wide, condition-specific regulatory networks in yeast as a model ![Glass et al., 2013](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0064832).

From the link of the paper's **KEY RESOURCES TABLE** I found the link of the **netZooM** which eventually lead me to the `PANDA` github page where I found the ![codes](https://github.com/netZoo/netZooM/tree/master/tutorials/panda) for reconstruction of the gene regulatory network in PANDA.
